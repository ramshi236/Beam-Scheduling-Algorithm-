# abstract 
An adaptive beam scheduling algorithm based on
covariance control strategy is proposed for an agile beam
radar in multi-target tracking applications. The algorithm
uses IMMKFs (Interacting Multiple Model Kalman Filters) to   track maneuvering targets. The optimal beam scheduling
model is built which can schedule radar beam based on the
difference between the desired covariance matrix and that of
the actual covariance of each target for maintaining the
target's state estimate covariance near a desired level. Two
kinds of beam scheduling algorithms, the minimum mean bias
criterion and the minimax bias criterion, are proposed,
respectively. Simulation results show that the algorithms
based on covariance control can quickly achieve the desired
tracking state and allocate sensor resources effectively
